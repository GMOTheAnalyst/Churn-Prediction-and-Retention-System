==========Retention_and_Revenue_Analysis ============
Customer Churn & Retention Intelligence System

## Purpose of This Phase

This phase moves the system from #classification to impact#.

After identifying which customers are active, at risk, or churned, the next step is to understand:
	-> How well the business is retaining customers over time
	-> How churn and risk translate into revenue loss or protection opportunities

This phase answers two critical questions:

	* What is the retention rate month over month?
	* How much revenue is at risk due to churn or inactivity?


	*********Key Objectives****

The retention and revenue analysis focuses on:

	-> Measuring customer retention over time
	->Identifying trends and changes in retention performance
	->Quantifying the financial impact of churn
	->Highlighting high-value customers who require immediate retention action

This ensures that churn analysis leads to #prioritized business decisions#, not just statistics.


	## Retention Analysis Logic

 #Retention:
A customer is considered #retained if they:
	->Were active in a previous month, and
	->Are also active in the current month

Retention is measured on a #month-over-month basis# to detect changes in customer behavior over time.

	### Metrics Produced

	->Number of active customers per month
	->Number of retained customers per month
	->Month-over-month retention rate
	->Retention trend over time

These metrics reveal whether retention strategies are improving or declining.

	## Revenue Impact Analysis Logic

Revenue at Risk:
Revenue at risk represents the potential financial loss if:
	->At-risk customers churn
	-> Churned customers do not return

This analysis combines:
	-> Customer lifetime value
	->Churn status
	->Recent activity patterns

### Metrics Produced

	->Total lifetime revenue per customer
	->Revenue contributed by churned customers
	->Revenue contributed by at-risk customers
	->Percentage of total revenue at risk

This allows the business to see churn not just as customer loss, but as #measurable financial exposure#.


	## High-Value Customer Prioritization

This phase also identifies:
	->High-value customers
	->With long inactivity periods
	->Who have not yet fully churned

These customers represent the #highest return on retention efforts#.

By ranking customers by revenue and inactivity, retention teams can focus on actions that maximize impact.


	## Data Sources Used

This analysis relies on previously created components:
	->Customer metrics views
	->Churn classification results
	->Monthly activity summaries
	->Lifetime value calculations

No raw tables are queried directly.  
All logic builds on standardized, reusable views.


	## Output of This Phase

retention_and_revenue_analysis.sql which is suitable for dashboards, reports, or executive summaries: 
	->Monthly retention metrics
	->Revenue at risk summaries
	->Ranked lists of high-value at-risk customers
	->Trend-ready datasets for reporting or visualization


	## Why This Phase Matters

Retention and revenue analysis is where analytics becomes strategy.

Without retention and revenue analysis
	->Churn insights remain abstract
	->Revenue risk stays hidden
	->Retention efforts lack prioritization

With retention and revenue analysis:
	->Business decisions are guided by data
	->Resources are focused on high-impact customers
	->Retention performance can be measured and improv
