##Conclusion

This project demonstrates how structured SQL analysis can transform raw transactional data into actionable business intelligence.

By:
	->Defining churn behaviorally
	->Measuring retention over time
	->Quantifying revenue risk
	->Prioritizing high-value customers

The system enables informed, proactive retention strategies that protect revenue and increase customer lifetime value. The database is no longer just a storage layer.  It has become a decision-support system.

At this point, the project is complete, coherent, and defensible:

	->Business problem defined

	->Data model designed

	->Schema implemented

	->Metrics engineered

	->Churn analyzed

	->Retention and revenue evaluated

	->Insights delivered
