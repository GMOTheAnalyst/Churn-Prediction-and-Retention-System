Customer Churn & Retention Intelligence System - CCRIS

_______________Purpose of the Data Model____________

This data model is designed to directly support the core business goal of the project:

To identify who is likely to leave, understand why they leave, and enable targeted retention actions that protect revenue and increase customer lifetime value.

The model focuses on capturing customer identity, transactional behavior, time-based activity, and revenue signals in a way that makes churn measurable and explainable using SQL.

Every table exists because it answers at least one business question.  
If a table does not support a question, it does not belong here.


___________ Business Logic Translation____________

Before defining tables, the business questions are translated into measurable concepts.

- #Churn: A customer is considered churned if they have made no purchases in the last 90 days.
- #Active: A customer who has made a purchase within the last 30 days.
- #At Risk: A customer inactive for 31–89 days.
- #Revenue: Total monetary value generated from completed purchases.
- #Retention: A customer who was active in the previous month and remains active in the current month.

These definitions guide the schema design and ensure consistency across all analyses.



	_____________Core Entities and Tables___________________

	# 1. Customers Table

#Purpose:
Stores customer identity and lifecycle entry point.

This table answers:
- Who the customers are
- When they joined
- How customers are uniquely identified across the system

#Key Fields:
- customer_id (primary key)
- full_name
- email
- signup_date
- status

#Business Questions Supported:
- Who has churned, who is active, who is at risk
- Retention and churn segmentation


	# 2. Orders Table

#Purpose
Captures purchase events and customer activity over time.

This is the primary table used to define churn, retention, and activity timelines.

#Key Fields:
- order_id (primary key)
- customer_id (foreign key)
- order_date
- order_status
- order_amount

#Business Questions Supported:
- Churn definition based on last purchase date
- Monthly churn rate calculation
- Retention rate month over month
- Activity trends over time


	#3. Payments Table

#Purpose:
Tracks actual revenue generated from orders.

Separating payments from orders allows accurate revenue calculations and avoids counting failed or pending transactions.

#Key Fields:
- payment_id (primary key)
- order_id (foreign key)
- payment_date
- payment_amount
- payment_status

#Business Questions Supported:
- Which customers generate the most revenue
- Lifetime value (LTV) computation
- Revenue at risk due to churn



	# 4. Customer Revenue Summary (Derived)

#Purpose:
Provides aggregated revenue metrics per customer.

This is not a physical table initially, but a derived dataset created using SQL views or queries.

#Metrics Derived:
- Total lifetime revenue per customer
- Average order value
- Number of completed purchases

#Business Questions Supported:
- High-value customer identification
- Revenue impact of churn
- Prioritization of retention efforts


	# 5. Customer Activity Metrics (Derived)

#Purpose:
Creates time-based behavioral signals needed for churn and retention analysis.

Derived metrics include:
- Last purchase date
- Days since last purchase
- Monthly purchase frequency

#Business Questions Supported:
- Who has churned, who is active, who is at risk
- Monthly churn trends
- Retention tracking



# Relationships Between Tables:

- One customer can have many orders  
- One order can have one or many payment records  
- Revenue is calculated from successful payments  
- Churn and retention are inferred from order dates, not customer status flags  

This relational structure ensures flexibility and prevents hard-coded assumptions about customer behavior.


	# How the Data Model Supports Each Business Question

-> Question 1  
Who has churned, who is active, and who is at risk?

- Derived from customers joined with orders
- Based on last purchase date and inactivity duration


-> Question 2  
What is the monthly churn rate and trend?

- Orders table provides monthly activity counts
- Customer absence in subsequent months signals churn


-> Question 3  
Which customers generate the most revenue and how does churn affect revenue?

- Payments aggregated per customer calculate LTV
- Churned customers with high LTV indicate revenue at risk


-> Question 4  
Which high-value customers are at highest risk of churn?

- Combine revenue summaries with inactivity metrics
- Enables prioritized retention targeting


-> Question 5  
What is the retention rate month over month?

- Identify customers active in consecutive months
- Track retention improvements over time



	->Design Principles

- Time is treated as a first-class dimension
- Churn is behavior-based, not manually labeled
- Revenue calculations rely on completed payments only
- Derived metrics are created through SQL views, not stored redundantly
